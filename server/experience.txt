Manual Testing ==> Manual testing mainly involves the phyysical execution of test cases againt various applications for detect bugs and errors 
simply sari testing hume khud se karni hoti h 

limitations of manual testing==>
# extremely time consuming
# high risk of error
# requires a tester all the time
# limited scope

Birth of Selenium(automation testing)==>

Jason Huggins, an engineer at THOUGHWORKS, chicago found the repitious work of manual testing strenous and monotonous
He developed a Javascript program to utomate the testing of a web application
The program was called JAVASCRIPT TEST RUNNER
Initally the new invention was deployed by the inmates at THOUGHWORKS. 
However in 2004, it was rendred as SELENIUM ans was made open source

Advantage of SELENIUM
# speed of execution
# accurte results
# lesser investement in human resource
# time and cost effective
# early time to market
# supports re-testing

SELENIUM consists of set of software tools that facilitate testing


////////////////////////////////////////////////

SELENIUM suite of tools

1.Selenium IDE
2.Selenium RC (depreacted)
3.Selenium WebDriver 
4.Selenium Grid 


////////////////////////////////////////////////

1.Selnium IDE 

firefox add-on that helps create tests
Records user interaction on the browser and exports them as a reusable script
generally used as a prototyping tool
install Selenium IDE from chrom extension
simple hum website (URL dalkar) open karke record kardenge then play karenge so automatic tesing hojayegi

Limitation==>

# cannot exports to webdriver scripts youtube
# cannot perform databse testing
# cannnot provide detailed test report

////////////////////////////////////////////////

2. Selenium  rc ==> Selenium RC cutoff in September 2021, Selenium RC (Remote Control) is an older, deprecated technology. It has been replaced by Selenium WebDriver, which is a more modern and powerful tool for browser automation.


////////////////////////////////////////////////


3. Selenium webdrivers==>

It is a cross platform (can run on any os) testing framework
It is not an Ide. It is programming interface to create and run test cases 
Supports Jva,C##,PHP,Python,Perl<RUby etc.
Supports frameworks like testing,junit,nunit


Limitation ==>
# Cannot test mobile Applications, Requires framework like Appium
# Can only perform sequential testing hece requires Grid fro parallel testing
# limites reporting. Third party tools like testNg are required
# Limited image testing
